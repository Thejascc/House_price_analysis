# Data Exploration and Visualization Analysis

## Overview
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing numerical and categorical variables. The key tasks include identifying and handling outliers, checking for normality, and visualizing the relationships between variables.

## Contents

+ ***Data Exploration***
    + Checking skewness and kurtosis of numerical columns.
    + Performing transformations to address skewness.
+ ***Outlier Detection:***
    + Identifying outliers using mean and standard deviation.
    + Using the Z-score method to detect outliers.
    + Applying different methods to handle outliers: trimming, capping, and imputation.
+ ***Visualizations:***
    + Histograms: To check the normality of the price_per_sqft column before and after transformations.
    + Box Plots: To visualize the distribution of numerical variables and identify outliers.
    + Scatter Plots: To examine the correlation between pairs of numerical variables.
    + Pair Plots: To provide a comprehensive view of relationships between multiple numerical variables.
    + Regression Plots: To visualize linear relationships between pairs of numerical variables.
    + Heatmap: To visualize the correlation matrix of numerical variables.
+ ***Files***
    + data_exploration_analysis.py: Python script containing the data exploration, outlier detection, and transformation code.
    + data_visualization_correlation_analysis.py: Python script for creating visualizations and analyzing correlations.
    + exploratory_data_analysis.py: Comprehensive script for performing all EDA tasks and generating visualizations.
  
+ ***Notes***
    + Handling Skewness: Transformations such as log transformation or cube root transformation are used to address skewness in the data.
    + Outlier Methods: Various methods are applied to detect and handle outliers, ensuring robust data analysis.
    + Visualization Choices: Different plots are used to gain insights into the relationships and distribution of the data.
